data ="""**Not Urgent and Not Important (Quadrant IV)**:
   - Watching the last 3 episodes of his favorite TV series.

Watching the last 3 episodes of her favorite TV series is not an activity that Sofia has to do. Maybe this is part of a hobby or activity that Sofia usually does in her free time. Therefore, Sofia does not need to pay special attention to this activity, because it can be done if Sofia has free time.

If we look at all the list of activities that will come or be done, there are still many important things that Sofia can do first, because many of the activities that Sofia will do will take a long time, so watching the last 3 episodes of her favorite TV series can be done after all. list of activities completed. Therefore, I put this activity into quadrant 4 as a routine that is not urgent and not important.
